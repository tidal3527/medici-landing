                The Medici family helped finance the Renaissance. They funded artists, inventors and thinkers like Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo and Michelangelo. They used capital to back ideas and people who went on to shape human history.
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe that kind of world should be possible again. A world where anyone, regardless of wealth, can act like a Medici and carefully deploy capital toward people they believe in.
              </p>

              <p>
                Named after the famed family, Medici is a platform to invest in people. We're building transparent, on-chain infrastructure for human capital funding. At launch, we enable direct peer-to-peer education funding for university students. Next, we'll expand to income-sharing grants where donors can strategically back individuals - whether researchers, founders or creatives - and share in their future.
              </p>

              <p>
                The current student debt system is inefficient, extractive and predatory. It works for no one. It limits freedom and punishes ambition. We want to replace it with something better: something aligned with student success and risk-taking, not just repayment schedules.
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe the world can enter multiple new renaissances. Talent doesn't just surface on its own. It needs to be discovered and nurtured.
              </p>

              <p>
                Medici is built by <strong>Miruvor Labs</strong>, an R&D studio focused on leveraging blockchain technologies to explore how humans can reorganize themselves to drive better collective outcomes.
